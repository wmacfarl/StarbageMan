boss001.mp3,Welcome to Greentech Space Disposal Solutions
boss002.mp3,If you're wondering how I'm talking to you~ I've been informed by our scientists that your ship's computer is accessing your optical nerve and audio centers via high intensity microwaves.
boss003.mp3,My understanding is that if you've survived this long~ they they're harmless.
boss004.mp3,I'm not sure how you got on board~ but by entering the ship you have agreed to our end user license agreement and are now an employee of Greentech Space Disposal Solutions.
boss005.mp3,You are aboard one of our top of the line garbage freighters on a mission hauling radioactive waste from planet Proctaris to the nearest black hole.
boss006.mp3,As our innovative heat distribution system~ YOU will keep the waste from damaging the internal systems of the ship.  
boss007.mp3,By moving the pellets of waste from one storage tank to another before they heat it to the point of rupture...
boss008.mp3,We can be assured that the ship will get the black hole.
boss009.mp3,Just keep an eye on the color of the tank walls.
boss010.mp3,The doors to the tanks will open automatically when you approach them.
boss011.mp3,Also~ please do not disturb the crew in the front of the ship.
boss012.mp3,Congratulations~ Due to a radiation leak which you seem to be immune to you have been promoted to captain.
boss013.mp3,Please head to the cockpit fo the ship for further instructions.
boss014.mp3,Due to budget cutbacks you are not only the captain~ but the entire crew! 
boss015.mp3,Marvel in your newfound responsibility.
boss016.mp3,To pilot the ship~ walk forward to the main console in the center of the ship.
boss017.mp3,Use the W~ A~ S~ and D keys to pilot the ship.
boss018.mp3,The scientists say to press the E key on the keyboard to Leave the station.
boss019.mp3,What do you mean you don't know where Proctaris is!?!?
boss020.mp3,Fine~ press E to Exit the station
boss021.mp3,now walk over to the Pink panel on your left to access the nav computer.
boss022.mp3,Look at that~ a perfect rendition of the sector.  And look at that~ it's your ship.
boss023.mp3,I've also indicated Proctaris
boss024.mp3,And look~ they have another pickup for you.
boss025.mp3,Head back to the pilot station to head over there.
boss026.mp3,We've indicated an orbit to fly into.  Head for that.
boss027.mp3,Once in orbit you'll automatically pickup any waste they have.
boss028.mp3,Once in orbit~ press the SPACE key to pick up any waste they have.
boss029.mp3,Now that you're loaded up~ head back to the black hole.
boss030.mp3,Go ahead and orbit the black hole.  Don't fall in.  We don't need any more spaghetti on our hands.
boss031.mp3,Now that you're in orbit~ go ahead and press the space bar to fire a waste pellet into it.
boss032.mp3,Now that your'e all done~ head back for another load~  I see they have another pickup.
boss033.mp3,They have a lot more this time.
boss034.mp3,Keep an eye on the temperature of the load.  
boss035.mp3,You may have to run to the back to redistribute it.
boss036.mp3,The more waste in a tank the faster it heats up.
boss037.mp3,Remember~ empty tanks cool much faster.
boss038.mp3,If you don't want ot run to the back to check every time~ you can check the temperature guages on the yellow console on your right.
boss039.mp3,Congratulations.  Due to budget cutbacks~ you've been promoted to Sector Manager.
boss040.mp3,You in fact~ manage yourself.  But now you have two planets to supervise.
boss041.mp3,Once again your continuing survival has earned you another promotion.  
boss042.mp3,As regional manager~ you are in charge of all of the planets in this Region.
boss043.mp3,All our waste haulers are Region locked.  If you accidentally leave the region~ the ship just uses a blink drive to teleport you back to the other side.
boss044.mp3,But why would you want to leave anyway?
boss045.mp3,You can't leave the region until your shift ends~ which is in approximately 138 years.
boss046.mp3,You let Gulfunkus explode!  Now who's going to pay their bill!  
boss047.mp3,This is coming out of your wages!
boss048.mp3,You let [unnamed planet] explode.
boss049.mp3,Next time you should be a little more considerate.
boss050.mp3,No~ the firing mechanism can only be deployed in the vacinity of a strong gravity well.
boss051.mp3,We could do without another Galat VII.  I mean~ we already are.
boss054.mp3,Of course you can't control the ship from the Nav computer.  Tell the pilot where to go.
boss055.mp3,What do you mean you are the pilot?  Go over to the main console and do your job~ then.
boss056.mp3,You should really keep an eye on your storage tanks.  
boss057.mp3,Red is bad~ you know.
boss058.mp3,The heat buildup caused the storage tanks to rupture~ causing your whole ship to explode.
boss059.mp3,The cost of your recovery and repair of the ship will be taken from your wages.
boss060.mp3,Our accountants say that adds 1.2 million years to your contract.
boss061.mp3,Next time~ be a little more careful.
boss062.mp3,The waste that you let build up on that planet has resulted in a meltdown.
boss063.mp3,Our scientists say that the surface will be inhabitable again in a three million years.
boss064.mp3,This .05% drop in revenue for us is truely devastating.
boss065.mp3,Next time you should be more considerate.
